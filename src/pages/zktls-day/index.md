# zkTLS Day at Devconnect 2025

**¿Dónde están las pruebas?**  
Right here! 🔥 Come to zkTLS day to learn how TLS becomes privately verifiable.

**Date**: November 19, 2025  
**Location**: La Rural, Buenos Aires 🇦🇷  
**Part of**: [Devconnect 2025](https://devconnect.org/calendar)  
**[Tickets](https://devconnect.org/calendar?event=zktls-day)** 

A full day dedicated to learn about zkTLS.

Whether you are deep into zk tooling or just curious about the emerging zkTLS standard, this event brings together builders, researchers, and integrators to explore what zkTLS makes possible.

---

## Overview

zkTLS is **transformative technology** that's reshaping what we can do with our data on the internet. Imagine proving your bank balance, or GitHub contributions **without revealing the actual data** or needing cooperation from the service provider. That's the power of zkTLS!

🎯 **Two tracks, infinite possibilities:**

* **🧠 Main Track** - Dive deep with technical talks from the teams **building the future**. From protocol fundamentals to cutting-edge implementations, you'll hear directly from the pioneers who are making zkTLS a reality.

* **🧪 Workshop Track** - **Get your hands dirty!** No waiting, no tickets required. Just walk in and start building. Try multiple zkTLS implementations, complete challenges, and walk away with practical knowledge (plus maybe some swag 😉).

## 🧠 Main Track

Our speaker lineup represents the absolute cutting edge of zkTLS research and development:

🔹 **Protocol deep-dives**: Understand the cryptographic magic that makes zkTLS possible  
🔹 **Live demos**: See real applications proving private data right before your eyes  
🔹 **Ethereum integration**: Discover how zkTLS is unlocking new DeFi and identity primitives  
🔹 **Developer tools**: Get hands-on with the SDKs and frameworks that will power tomorrow's apps  

**Featuring the teams that are defining the space:** vLayer, Primus Labs, Reclaim Protocol, and TLSNotary.

🎟️ **Tickets** https://devconnect.org/calendar?event=zktls-day

## 🧪 Workshop Room

We have set up a **hands-on workshop space** where you can try multiple zkTLS implementations in practice.

The workshops run in parallel to the main track. You can walk in anytime and try different zkTLS flows at your own pace (around 15 minutes per tutorial, with optional advanced challenges). No ticket is required -- first come, first served.

The workshops start after their introduction in the main track at 11 and continue until 17:00.

You might even earn a POAP or some swag 🙂

The tutorials are organized by: [vLayer](https://www.vlayer.xyz/), [Primus Labs](https://primuslabs.xyz/), [Reclaim](https://reclaimprotocol.org/) and [TLSNotary](/)

## Talk details

### zkTLS fundamentals (Sinu, TLSNotary)
Start your zkTLS journey with a foundational session led by Sinu, the technical lead behind EF's TLSNotary project.
This talk traces the evolution of zkTLS and breaks down its core concepts, from proofs vs. attestations to the trade-offs between TEE-, proxy-, and MPC-based approaches.
You’ll learn how different trust models, privacy techniques, and verification methods shape the landscape of zkTLS, and gain a clear understanding of the performance and security considerations behind each design.

### Web proofs on Ethereum (Maciek Kalka, vLayer)
Join Maciej from vlayer for a deep dive into how zkTLS web proofs can power Ethereum ecosystem. This session explores the emerging design space of on-chain attestations - from cryptographic verification and the oracle problem to evolving trust assumptions in decentralized systems. Drawing on lessons from building zk tooling and infrastructure for practical web proofs, Maciej will highlight the promising directions for verifiable web data - and the approaches intentionally left behind along the way.

### Cryptography of zkTLS (Xiang Xie, Primus Labs)
Dive into the cryptographic foundations that make zkTLS possible with Xiang Xie, one of the leading minds behind protocols like Ferret, QuickSilver, and modern advances in Oblivious Transfer and Garbled Circuits.
This session will unpack the building blocks and explore how these primitives power practical, privacy-preserving zkTLS.
Whether you’re a cryptography enthusiast or a developer curious about the math behind zkTLS, this talk will illuminate how cutting-edge research translates into real-world privacy infrastructure.

### zkTLS for developers (Maddy, Reclaim Protocol)
Gain a developer’s perspective on bringing zkTLS from theory to production with Madhavan Malolan, founder of Reclaim Protocol.
This session distills hard-won insights from real integrations : from reverse-engineering APIs and handling data formats like HTML and JSON, to managing redaction, compatibility across platforms, and legal or UX considerations.
A practical deep dive into what it really takes to build privacy-preserving applications powered by zkTLS.

### Use case demos Part 1

* Trustless Verification for Financial Institutions (Kofi, cr3dentials.xyz)
* TLShare: Verifiable Inputs for Private Computation (Dimitris Mouris, Nilion)
* Proof of Humanity from Web Accounts (Mikhail, Bring ID)
* Fast, Permissionless On and Offramping (Sachin, zkp2p)


### Use case demos Part 2
* Verifiable Micropayments for API Data (Luís Freitas, MCPay)
* Web2-Backed On-Chain Credit (Carlos Ramos, Stormbit Labs)
* Verity: Trust-Minimized Data Flows for Smart Contracts (Ryan, Usher Labs)  
<!-- Usher Labs' Verity zkTLS stack enables trust-minimised data flows between traditional systems and blockchains. Integrate private or restricted data from any trusted API into your Smart Contracts. Building on TLSNotary, RiscZero, and the Internet Computer, the Verity stack provides a full-stack framework to extract, transform, and load data into blockchains with end-to-end verifiability. Think "zkRollup of TLS attestations".  -->
