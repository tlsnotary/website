# zkTLS Day at Devconnect 2025

**¿Dónde están las pruebas?**  
Right here! 🔥 Come to zkTLS day to learn how TLS becomes privately verifiable.

**Date**: November 19, 2025  
**Location**: La Rural, Buenos Aires 🇦🇷  
**Part of**: [Devconnect 2025](https://devconnect.org/calendar)

A full day dedicated to learn about zkTLS.

Whether you are deep into zk tooling or just curious about the emerging zkTLS standard, this event brings together builders, researchers, and integrators to explore what zkTLS makes possible.

## Overview

zkTLS is **transformative technology** that's reshaping what we can do with our data on the internet. Imagine proving your bank balance, or GitHub contributions **without revealing the actual data** or needing cooperation from the service provider. That's the power of zkTLS!

🎯 **Two tracks, infinite possibilities:**

* **🧠 Main Track** - Dive deep with technical talks from the teams **building the future**. From protocol fundamentals to cutting-edge implementations, you'll hear directly from the pioneers who are making zkTLS a reality.

* **🧪 Workshop Track** - **Get your hands dirty!** No waiting, no tickets required. Just walk in and start building. Try multiple zkTLS implementations, complete challenges, and walk away with practical knowledge (plus maybe some swag 😉).

## 🧠 Main Track

Our speaker lineup represents the absolute cutting edge of zkTLS research and development:

🔹 **Protocol deep-dives**: Understand the cryptographic magic that makes zkTLS possible  
🔹 **Live demos**: See real applications proving private data right before your eyes  
🔹 **Ethereum integration**: Discover how zkTLS is unlocking new DeFi and identity primitives  
🔹 **Developer tools**: Get hands-on with the SDKs and frameworks that will power tomorrow's apps  

**Featuring the teams that are defining the space:** vLayer, Primus Labs, Reclaim Protocol, and TLSNotary.

🎟️ **Tickets dropping soon—don't miss out!**

## 🧪 Workshop Room

We have set up a **hands-on workshop space** where you can try multiple zkTLS implementations in practice.

The workshops run in parallel to the main track. You can walk in anytime and try different zkTLS flows at your own pace (around 15 minutes per tutorial, with optional advanced challenges). No ticket is required -- first come, first served.

You might even earn a POAP or some swag 🙂

The tutorials are organized by: [vLayer](https://www.vlayer.xyz/), [Primus Labs](https://primuslabs.xyz/), [Reclaim](https://reclaimprotocol.org/) and [TLSNotary](/)

## Agenda

Talks will take place in the main stage room from **10:00 to 17:00**.
