# Quick Start

This quick start will help you get started with TLSNotary, both in native Rust and in the Browser.

## Objectives

- Gain a better understanding of what you can do with TLSNotary
- Learn the basics of how to prove and verify data using TLSNotary

## Rust

1. [Basic Verification Example](rust.md#basic): This example demonstrates how to use TLSNotary in a simple session between a Prover and a Verifier. It involves the Verifier first verifying the MPC-TLS session and then confirming the correctness of the data.
2. [Simple Attestation Example](rust.md#attestation): Use TLSNotary with a Notary attesting to the data.
3. [Zero-Knowledge Age Verification Example](rust.md#basic-zk): Demonstrates privacy-preserving age verification using TLSNotary and zero-knowledge proofs with Noir.

## Browser

The easiest way to get started with TLSNotary in the browser is to try the [interactive tutorial](https://demo.tlsnotary.org/tutorial/). It walks you through the full workflow — from running your first plugin to writing custom handlers.

You can also visit [demo.tlsnotary.org](https://demo.tlsnotary.org) to try pre-built plugins with no setup required.

For step-by-step installation and setup instructions, see the [Browser Quick Start](browser_extension).
