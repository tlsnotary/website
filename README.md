# TLSNotary Website

This repository contains the source files for the TLSNotary website: https://tlsnotary.org

The site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

### Local Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run start
```

This starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without needing to restart the server.

Before submitting a PR, please make sure there are no warnings when you run:
```sh
npm run build
```

### Diagrams

All diagrams are created using draw.io. The diagram source files are stored in the diagrams folder.
â€œBefore use, each diagram must be converted to both light and dark SVG versions with the `convert_all.sh` script in the same folder.
